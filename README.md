- There are 90,398 eligible retirees currently at Pewlett-Hackard
- There are 1,549 eligible mentors currently at Pewlett-Hackard

## Summary

As evidenced by this analysis, there is going to be a very large personnel void left at Hewlett-Packard by the impending "silver tsunami." There are 90,398 employees who are within a near-future retirement window. Simultaneously, there are very few (1,549) employees who are deemed eligible mentors according to the standards studied who can teach and shape the next generation before their retirement. In order to aid a smooth transition, I would recommend the following:
  1. Query the number of years in job role/at Pewlett-Hackard of the retirees and promote them to be "primary mentors."
  2. Query the number of "engineers" and "staff" who are NOT eligible for retirement and prioritize training those individuals to become senior engineers and senior  staff so that the next generation of leaders are from within the company and can train younger/newer employees with more expertise sooner.
